# UKCrimeAnalysis

This was done as a part of my internship at Sapio Analytics as a Data Analyst intern.

Analysis of UK crime data from January 2018 to June 2020 was done.
The data was downloaded from https://data.police.uk/


It was a publically available dataset consisting of enteries for each month for each year.
After combining and cleaning, it consisted of about 1,40,00,000 entries.
